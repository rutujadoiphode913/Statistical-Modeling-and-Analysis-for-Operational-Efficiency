Visualisation: Display of a Bar Chart: The code generates a bar chart that depicts the number of defective and non-defective items. This visualisation provides a graphical depiction of the distribution, making the ratio of faulty to non-defective items easier to understand. Probability of Defective Product Estimation (p): Based on the proportion of defective items in the given dataset, it computes the estimated probability 'p' of a product being defective.This predicted 'p' value offers information on the likelihood of encountering defective items in this manufacturing line. Probability Calculation for Future Defective Products: The code determines the likelihood of having more than 10 defective products out of the following 50 items using the estimated 'p' value.
